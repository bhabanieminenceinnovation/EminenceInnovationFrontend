                    <small className='text-secondary'><b>Does the company understand your business requirements?</b></small>
                    <small>Start by looking at how they conceptualize your needs. Examine their list of clients and the strategies they have previously delivered. Depending on the needs of each client, their solutions must be adapted.</small>
                    <small>An expert web development company tends to put itself in your position and offers solutions that are in line with your requirements, brand, audience, and goals.</small>
                    <small className='text-secondary'>Request testimonials and work samples</small>
                    <small>Choosing to work with a web development company is important; therefore, take into account the feedback from those who have already engaged the agency in a process.</small>

                    <small>Furthermore, go over the work samples they have presented and sketch down what you like and dislike.</small>
                    <small className='text-secondary'><b>Move past back-end development</b></small>
                    <small>The process of developing a website involves many different steps in addition to coding and programming. Select companies that have demonstrated expertise both in designing and developing responsive websites.</small>
                    <small>Device friendliness is a significant element because nearly 60% of web access occurs on mobile devices.</small>
                    <small>It is important to find a company that offers supplementary services in addition to web development if you want something developed that goes beyond a simple website. These might include QA assistance, automation, and the development of mobile apps.</small>
                    <small>Maintaining all of the teams under one roof not only ensures a unified strategy but also improves timeframe and communication.</small>
                    <small className='text-secondary'><b>Analyze the teamâ€™s expertise.</b></small>
                    <small>Analyze their experience and aptitude in the development of particular skill sets. Proficient resources are qualified in a variety of disciplines.</small>
                    <small>They should have a solid understanding of front-end and back-end, as well as best practices, algorithms, databases, and various architectures for web development.</small>
                    <small>An ideal web development company typically possesses a broad understanding of the sector along with a few specialized skills. They should also have team leads, QA engineers, solution architects, scrum masters, and graphic designers in addition to web developers and programmers.</small>
                    <small className='text-secondary'><b>Examine their web hosting services.</b></small>

                    <small>How frequently do they backup the website?</small>

                    <small>How fast is the hosting platform's processing power?</small>
                    <small>What is the uptime warranty?</small>
                    <small className='text-secondary'><b>Summing Up</b></small>
