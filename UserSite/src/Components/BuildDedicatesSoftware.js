                    <small>Global businesses work with outsourcing providers to enhance their effectiveness, break into new markets, and reduce costs. To scale quickly, cut costs, and lower associated risks, most of them evaluate choosing a dedicated development team.</small>
                    <small>Any business person will agree that there comes a point when your company needs top talent to complete specific tasks. But the required work can't be done by your internal team. In this situation, you assemble a committed team to complete the task.</small>
                    <small className='text-secondary'><b>But first, let's understand a dedicated team approach before moving on.</b></small>
                    <small>There are three models whenever a development company and the customer collaborate. One of the models, along with the fixed-price model and the time-and-materials model, is a committed team. Each of the models is distinctive in its way, and in this case, we'll talk about dedicated teams.</small>

                    <small>Business analysts</small>
                    <small> Frontend and Backend Developers</small>
                    <small>DevOps</small>
                    <small>Project Manager</small>
                    <small>UX/UI designers, and</small>
                    <small>Quality Assurance Specialists.</small>
