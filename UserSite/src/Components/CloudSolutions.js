      <small>Create together the perfect cloud solutions to accelerate digital transformation whenever and wherever you need it. Cloud-based services offer IT as a service over the Internet or a dedicated network, with on-demand delivery and usage-based billing. Top applications, development platforms, storage, servers, and virtual desktops are all examples of cloud-based services.</small>
      <small><b>Who uses Cloud Solutions and why?</b></small>
      <small>Cloud-based services are used by businesses and governments to meet a range of application performance requirements, including database, CRM, compute, and data storage.  </small>
      <small>Contrary to a classic IT environment, where software and hardware are paid for upfront by departments and implemented over months, cloud-based services ensure IT solutions in minutes to hours and compliance costs to actual usage. </small>
      <small>As a result, businesses are more flexible and have better expense control.</small>
      <small>Similarly, cloud-based services are used by consumers to simplify application usage, share, store, and protect content, and grant access to any internet-connected device.</small>

        <small><b>Working Pattern of Cloud Based Services</b></small>
        <small>Cloud services share several characteristics:</small>
        <ul>
          <li><small><b>Virtualization:</b></small></li>
          <small>To quickly allocate and reallocate resources, cloud computing heavily relies on server and storage virtualization.</small>
          <li><small><b>Multi-tenancy:</b></small></li>
          <small>It entails pooling and sharing resources among multiple users to achieve economies of scale.</small>
          <li><small><b>On-demand:</b></small></li>
          <small>On-demand resources have been self-provisioned to a collection of pre-defined configurations available online.</small>
          <li><small><b>Metering/chargeback:</b></small></li>
          <small>Tracking and billing of resource usage by service agreements.</small>
          <li><small><b>Network-access:</b></small></li>
          <small>Resources are made available using a web browser or a thin client on a variety of devices connected (computer, tablet, and smartphone)</small>
          <li><small><b>Elastic:</b></small></li>
          <small>Resources can be scaled up or down automatically.</small>
        </ul>
        <small>The most popular cloud-based services, whether they are offered by internal departments or external service providers, are:</small>
        <ul>
          <li><small>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) - software that runs on computer systems owned and operated by the SaaS provider, rather than on user computers that are installed and managed. The software is accessed through the public Internet and is typically available on a monthly or annual subscription basis.</small></li>
          <li><small>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) - The IaaS provider offers computing, networking, storage, and additional components (cloud security, tools) via the open Internet, a VPN, or a dedicated network connection. Users pay by the usage of the infrastructure and own and manage the operating systems, apps, and data that are running on it.</small></li>
          <li><small>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) - The PaaS provider makes available via the open Internet, a VPN, or a dedicated network all the software and hardware needed to create and run cloud-based applications.</small></li>
        </ul>
